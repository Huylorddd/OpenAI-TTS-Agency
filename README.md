         python get-pip.py

  8. **Reboot** your computer.


### STEP 3: Install Virtual Voice Assistant ü§ñ
  1. Install **'agency.py'** (en-US/vi-VN based on your convenient) to prepared folder that we've made before or copy/paste to your **py file**.
  2. In the code, we need to check & adjust a little bit:

     **‚û§ API KEY:** This key is provided by openAI to run the fully functional API. Otherwise, nothing happens.
     
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c4d61b9-2f95-41b9-8dc1-bbd0d51374de)

     **‚û§ MODELS & SYSTEM.CONTENT:**
     
       **Models:** choose the model that's suitable for your tasks. **Higher price the more different**. Checkout: https://openai.com/api/pricing
         
        > for example: if you want to use 'GPT-4.1' model -> model="gpt-4.1"
     
       **System.content:** adjust this field to change personality & performance for your assistant.
     
        > for example: if you want your assistant girly -> "as a helpful and cute girl, help me come up with quick and effective solutions"

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee1b7af3-a962-4746-8720-bdcb3268d227)

     **‚û§ VOICES:** options for your assitant's voice. Need to set your "#" like the image below if you want to use OpenAI gen voice and vice versa.

        -**FREE TEXT-TO-SPEECH:** this choice is using **Google Translate** voice, fast and no cost.

        -**COST TEXT-TO-SPEECH:** using **OpenAI** gen voice, natural and smooth talk. You can also change the model and type of voice if you want to.
    

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95f59554-c7bc-493e-b4ef-9fa4c62e8d13)

     ## ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
     If you're using **gpt-4.1-nano** or the older versions, the assistant is **dumber** and **too much mechanical**, the voice **cracks often** than the new one.

     ## GET OPENAI API KEY üîë
     1. Go to mainpage OpenAI and login/sign up your account. src: https://openai.com/api/
    
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec93ab29-31c5-4626-9a74-669a3b1cbeec)

     2. Create a **project** for your purpose
    
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff514af3-c2cd-4049-bc79-aa8644adfe44)
        
     3. Create **a or more**(if you want to) new **secret/api keys**

        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fefef63-2d8a-47bd-b568-a8eb064b660d)

     4. A table will show and you need to fill the name field and choose your project that we've just created.
    
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a36fca1-d850-404d-9f16-25664c22890a)

     5. The **API key** will appear and you can copy/paste it to your "**API KEY**" in your code
    
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34e27839-c527-475e-9915-fed8650822a1)

     ## ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
     You need to **save** your **API key** at safe place and don't let anyone know that as they'll use yours without paying.
     If someone already knows, you can **revoke** your **API key** and create a **new one**.

       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f506f47-a1b2-4071-9a8b-6b30e3d5add7)

     ## PAYING TO USE üíµ
     Since the models we're using belong to **OpenAI**, so you need to have balance in your account to keep using the API.
     Don't worry! You can choose the model that suits your budget.

       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/415b2857-0a36-4e27-9f1c-58ed56b86272)


     ### Add payment method and balance to your account
       1. Move to **Billing** section -> choose **Add payment method** and add your payment.
       2. Add your amount of balance.
        > between 5$ and 95$. You can enable auto-recharge for automatically paying when your balance goes empty.

### Check how much balance you have used for API

**Token:** unit of measure for the amount payable.
At the **Usage** section, there are 2 things you have to pay attention.

‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ **Total Spend:** This field shows you how much **money** you've used for **API calls**.

   > The price it costs based on which model you're using. 

‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ **Chat Completion:** This field shows how many **requests** you've called.

   > Each **request** has different **tokens**. The newer model the more tokens it uses.
